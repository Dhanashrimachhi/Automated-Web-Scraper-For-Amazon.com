# Automated-Web-Scraper-For-Amazon.com

In this tutorial we will build an Automated Web Scraper to extract data from amazon.com that we can use for any data analysis,data science or machine learning project. 

Before we get started let me make it clear that Amazon has a tight security for their platform and some of the things you can easily do on other webpages wont work on Amozon platform. 

Previously, we could have used Beautiful Soup and Request to easily get titles from the page, but things have changed little bit. We will still use Beautiful Soup but in a different way. 

## **Prerequisites**
